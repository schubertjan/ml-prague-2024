Steam processing ML
* one use only model
* train a model, fine tune the parameters 

Pitch recognition
* use syntheticly generated data to train a NN


# Top take aways
People almost always have some data, they sometimes take a long way to get them. If none, they use synthetic data
Transformers are popular
LLMs can't reason, they can't abstract
LLMs can be expensive to deploy in production
MLOps is crucial for any advanced ML
Evaluation is key for LLMs
Take pretrained models, don't start from scratch
